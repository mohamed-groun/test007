# FAQ
faq:
  title: "FAQ - Image PDF Generator"
  question1: "What is a DTF generator?"
  answer1: "A DTF generator is a tool that automatically creates DTF sheets or rolls from your images. It optimizes the layout of visuals on DTF transfer film to reduce waste and produce print-ready results."
  question2: "How does the DTF sheet generator work?"
  answer2: "You upload your images (PDF, PNG), define their dimensions and quantities, and the DTF generator automatically arranges them on an optimized DTF sheet or roll. A print-ready PDF file is then generated."
  question3: "Can I optimize my DTF prints to reduce waste?"
  answer3: "Yes, optimization is one of the main benefits of the DTF generator. It minimizes unused space on DTF sheets and rolls, reducing DTF transfer film consumption."
  question4: "What is DTF transfer film used for?"
  answer4: "DTF transfer film is used in Direct-To-Film printing. It allows printed designs to be transferred onto textiles after applying powder and using a heat press."
  question5: "How can I download the generated PDF?"
  answer5: "Once the images are uploaded, the application selects the best layout and allows you to download the PDF directly to your device."
  question6: "Is the application secure for my files?"
  answer6: "Yes, your images and PDFs are processed securely. No files are shared publicly, and all data is protected to ensure your privacy."
